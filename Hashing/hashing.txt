//Hashing-->>

Prestore something and fetch when it requires...

for example if any array given [1,2,1,3,2]

in hashing we create array at max of 12 or 15

and that array called hash array

hash array/frequancy array = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, 0]
              0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12

              go to first array and take 1 and then go hash array and at first postion and tell remember 1 and then go
              2 in first array and in hash array tell remember 2 at position of 2 and again to value of 1 and then first 
              array and tell that remember value of 1 at position of 1 and it will remember/store 2 means value of 1 is stored 2 time
              means value 1 is 2 times in the first array...

              if we wanna know frequancy or how many same number in the we directly print hash[1] its tell how many 1 is present in the 
              first array..

query --->>>

its basically no. of times of no. of quaries to run loop for print frequancy of no. in array

example -- suppose we take q =5 to check frequancy of number in a given array 1,2,5,4,2
so it will run five times for first times its enter in the loop then we take any no. to check the frequency in the array
for eg. we take 2 it will show the frequency 2.

so the value of q can be any thing instead of negative it can less or greater than no. of elements in the array


// Size of hash--->>>

inside main the maximum size of hash can be only declare 10^6.. for bool array inside main 10^7..
if we declare globally(outside from main) size of hash then it can 10^7.. for bool array globally can 10^8..
For enter max size of number then there are stl in cpp..

// Segmentation Fault--->>>
It is specific kind of error that occurs when program tries to access restricted area of memory..

//Control reach and non void function error-->>

-- this error show when in there a path in your code where function might finish without returning anything..

//Characters hashing-->>>

In characters hashing first we have to create a array of size 26 name of hash then enter the value of string in the hash array
using ASCII keys ...

-- In characters hashing there is'nt any kind of problem of space.. because there are only 256 char so array can strore 256 characters..


//Hash Map in cpp-->>>

-- Map is defined as key and value syntax of map is map<key,value>
   key==number value==frequancy                      number,frequancy

   map store all the value in sorted order..

Time complexity of map -->>

Storing and fetching takes log(n)  n-- number of elements

unorder map -->> in unorder  o(1) -- average best
                  -- worst o(n)


//Hashing -->> 1.Division method (linear changing)
               2.Folding method
               3.Mid sqaure method
